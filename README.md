# Image Viewer

This is a simple Image Viewer application built using Python's Tkinter library and PIL (Pillow) for handling images. The viewer allows you to navigate through a set of images using "Next" and "Back" buttons.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- Pillow library

## Installation

1. Install the Pillow library if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```

2. Clone this repository or download the `image_viewer.py` file.

3. Ensure you have a folder named `cats` in the same directory as the script, containing the images `1.jpg`, `2.jpeg`, `3.jpg`, `4.jpg`, and `5.jpeg`.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python image_viewer.py
